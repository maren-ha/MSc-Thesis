\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

First and foremost, I thank Harald Binder for his invaluable support and encouragement, for introducing me to a fascinating field of research and giving me the opportunity to write this thesis, and for never running out of good ideas. 

Also, I am very grateful to Peter Pfaffelhuber for co-supervising this thesis. 

I thoroughly appreciate the positive and supportive atmosphere at the IMBI and feel honoured to have met and worked with such fantastic colleagues.
In particular, I would like to thank the members of the AG Machine Learning: 
Caroline Broichhagen, Daniela Zöller, Göran Köber, Kiana Farhadyar, Martin Treppner, Moritz Hess and Stefan Lenz. 

Considering myself extremely lucky to have friends both very supportive and skilled in mathematics and statistics, I am deeply grateful to Anselm Hudde, Maja von Cube, Nora Scherer and Pascal Schlosser for the time they took to discuss and proofread this thesis and for all their helpful comments. 

My final thanks go to my brother Paul, who so generously helped me out with the necessary hardware, to my parents Anke and Thomas and to Anselm for always standing behind me and for unconditionally and unfailingly believing in me.
